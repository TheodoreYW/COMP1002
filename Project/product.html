    <h3>
        The DeLorean's engine is a Peugeot-Renault-Volvo (PRV) 2.85 L (174 cu in) SOHC V6, 
        rated at 130 hp (132 PS; 97 kW) at 5,500 rpm and torque of 153 lb⋅ft (207 N⋅m) at 2,750 rpm.
         These PRVs were a development of the 2.7-litre V6 used in the Renault 30 that were designed and built under 
         special contract with the DeLorean Motor Company

     <h3>
        This engine has a 90-degree layout with a light-alloy block with cast iron cylinder liners and light-alloy heads with cross-flow hemi-chambers.
         It is cooled by a front-mounted radiator with twin-thermostatically controlled electric cooling fans.
          The engine has a 91 mm (3.6 in) bore and 73 mm (2.9 in) stroke, a compression ratio of 8.8:1 and was fitted with a Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system.

Two transmissions were available for the DeLorean: a 5-speed manual and a 3-speed automatic, both with a final drive ratio of 3.44:1

     <h3>
        The DeLorean has a four-wheel independent suspension with coil springs, and telescopic shock absorbers. The front suspension uses double wishbones, while the rear is a multi-link setup.

When the DeLorean first arrived in the US, the car had a higher-than-expected wheel gap in the front suspension. Despite having significantly less weight in the front,
 the front and rear springs had the same spring rate and used lower-quality steel, which resulted in the nose-high look.[44] Some people have cited a last-minute change in 
 US bumper height requirements led DMC to raise the vehicle just prior to delivery; however, this is not true. Design drawings show that the design met NHTSA minimum bumper
  and headlight heights of the time
