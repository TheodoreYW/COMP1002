      <h3>
        The DMC DeLorean is a rear-engine two-passenger sports car manufactured and marketed by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company 
        (DMC) for the American market from 1981 until 1983â€”ultimately the only car brought to market by the fledgling company. 
        The DeLorean is sometimes referred to by its internal DMC pre-production designation, DMC-12

      <h3>
        Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and noted for its gull-wing doors and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels,
         the sports car was also noted for a lack of power and performance incongruous with its looks and price. 
         Though its production was short-lived, the DeLorean became widely known after it was featured as the time machine in the Back to the Future films.
         With the first production car completed on January 21, 1981, the design incorporated numerous minor revisions to the hood, 
         wheels and interior before production ended in late December 1982, shortly after DMC filed for bankruptcy and after total production reached about 9,000 units.

      <h3>
        When details surrounding the DeLorean were first announced in the mid-1970s, there were numerous plans and rumors that the DeLorean would have many advanced features, 
        such as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), a unit construction plastic chassis, a mid-engine layout, an airbag, 10-mph bumpers and ultrawide Pirelli P7 tires; none of these would materialize in the production vehicle
